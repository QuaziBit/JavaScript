            jQuery, at its core, is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click).<br />

            jQuery also provides a paradigm for event handling that goes beyond basic DOM element selection and manipulation. The event assignment and the event callback function definition are done in a single step in a single location in the code. jQuery also aims to incorporate other highly used JavaScript functionality (e.g. fade ins and fade outs when hiding elements, animations by manipulating CSS properties). <br />

        <p id="content">
            jQuery was originally created in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig and was influenced by Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library.[10][11] It is currently maintained by a team of developers led by Timmy Willison (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being led by Richard Gibson).<br />

            jQuery was originally licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.5, and relicensed to the MIT license in 2006.[12] At the end of 2006, it was dual-licensed under GPL and MIT licenses.[13] As this led to some confusion, in 2012 the GPL was dropped and is now only licensed under the MIT license.[14]<br />
                
            In 2015, jQuery was used on 63% of the top 1 million websites (according to BuiltWith), and 17% of all Internet websites.[15] As of June 2018, jQuery is used on 73% of the top 1 million websites, and by 22.4% of all websites (according to BuiltWith).[16] <br />

        <p id="content">
            <strong>jQuery includes the following features:</strong><br /> 

            DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project[17]<br /> 
            DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in the DOM<br /> 
            Events<br /> 
            Effects and animations<br /> 
            Ajax<br /> 
            Deferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processing<br /> 
            JSON parsing<br /> 
            Extensibility through plug-ins<br /> 
            Utilities, such as feature detection<br /> 
            Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers, but need fallbacks for older browsers, such as jQuery.inArray() and jQuery.each().<br /> 
            Cross-browser support<br />        
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            jQuery 3.0 & newer supports "currentâˆ’1 versions" (meaning the current stable version of the browser and the version that preceded it) of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge as well as Internet Explorer 9 & newer. On mobile it supports iOS 7 & newer and Android 4.0 & newer.[18]<br />

        <p id="content">
            The jQuery library is typically distributed as a single JavaScript file that defines all its interfaces, including DOM, Events, and Ajax functions. It can be included within a Web page by linking to a local copy, or by linking to one of the many copies available from public servers. jQuery has a content delivery network (CDN) hosted by MaxCDN.[19] Google and Microsoft host the library as well.[20][21]<br />
